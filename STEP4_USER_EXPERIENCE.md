   - Show how much was truncated
   - Explain token impact
   - Offer to increase limit in settings

#### Benefits
- Users understand why operations fail
- Reduces frustration
- Educational about security
- Clear path to resolution

---

### Task 6: Performance Optimization
**Priority**: Low  
**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes

#### Changes Required
1. Cache safety validation results:
   - Cache command validation for 60 seconds
   - Invalidate on settings change
   - Reduces repeated checks

2. Optimize truncation function:
   - Only parse JSON once
   - Use binary search for truncation point
   - Add performance metrics logging

3. Async safety checks where possible:
   - Don't block UI during validation
   - Show spinner for long validations
   - Cancel checks on user action

#### Benefits
- Faster response times
