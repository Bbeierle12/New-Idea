# Conversational Agent Mode - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully upgraded the Agent mode from "one-shot goal execution" to **conversational multi-turn chat** with unrestricted tool access. Both Chat and Agent modes now share the same conversational interface, with Agent mode automatically injecting the agent system prompt.

## Key Changes

### 1. Unified Conversational Interface
**Before**: 
- Chat mode: Multi-turn conversations with history
- Agent mode: One-shot execution (enter goal â†’ run â†’ complete â†’ clear)

**After**:
- Chat mode: Multi-turn conversations (same as before)
- Agent mode: **Multi-turn conversations with agent system prompt**
- Both modes maintain full conversation history
- Both modes support streaming responses
- Both modes use the same UI and interaction patterns

### 2. Agent System Prompt Injection
The agent mode now automatically injects the configurable agent system prompt at the start of each LLM call:

```python
if mode == "agent" and self._messages:
    # Inject agent system prompt at the beginning
    conversation.append(ChatMessage(role="system", content=self._agent_prompt))
    # Add all user/assistant messages
    conversation.extend([...])
```

This gives the Agent mode "unrestricted" behavior while keeping the conversational flow natural.

### 3. Simplified UI
- **Removed**: "Goal" and "Status" labels from agent mode
- **Removed**: Height difference between chat (4 lines) and agent (2 lines)
- **Updated**: Action button always says "Send" (no more "Run")
- **Result**: Both modes look and feel identical, differing only in system prompt

### 4. Code Consolidation
**Removed old agent methods**:
- `_on_run_agent()` - One-shot execution
- `_render_agent_conversation()` - Special agent rendering
- `_append_line()` - Agent-specific formatting
- `_append_text()` - Duplicate text insertion

**Updated unified method**:
- `_on_send_or_run()` - Handles both chat and agent modes
- `_chat_loop_streaming()` - Now accepts mode parameter
- Smart conversation building with conditional system prompt injection

## Technical Implementation

### Conversation Flow

**Chat Mode**:
```
User Message â†’ Add to history â†’ LLM (no system prompt) â†’ Stream response â†’ Continue
```

**Agent Mode**:
```
User Message â†’ Add to history â†’ LLM (with agent prompt injected) â†’ Stream response â†’ Continue
```

### Message History Management
Both modes now share `self._messages` list:
- User messages are added immediately
- Assistant responses are appended after streaming
- Tool calls are logged and added to history
- History persists across multiple turns

### System Prompt Behavior
The agent system prompt is injected **on-the-fly** during each LLM call:
- Not stored in `self._messages` (keeps history clean)
- Always prepended to conversation when mode == "agent"
- Configurable via Settings â†’ Agent Prompt

## Benefits

### For Users:
âœ… **Natural Conversations**: No more one-shot limitations in agent mode
âœ… **Context Retention**: Agent remembers previous messages and tool calls
âœ… **Familiar UX**: Same interface for both modes
âœ… **Flexible Switching**: Toggle between chat and agent mid-conversation
âœ… **Unrestricted Access**: Agent mode can use all tools with full permissions

### For Developers:
âœ… **Less Code**: Removed ~100 lines of duplicate agent logic
âœ… **Single Code Path**: One method handles both modes
âœ… **Easier Maintenance**: No parallel implementations to keep in sync
âœ… **Clear Separation**: Mode difference is only the system prompt

## Usage Examples

### Chat Mode (Helpful Assistant)
```
You: What glyphs are available?
Assistant: Let me check... [tool:list_glyphs] ... You have 3 glyphs: deploy, test, build.

You: Run the test glyph
Assistant: [tool:run_glyph(test)] Running tests... âœ“ All tests passed!
```

### Agent Mode (Unrestricted Tool User)
```
You: List all glyphs and write them to a file
Assistant: [tool:list_glyphs] Found 3 glyphs. [tool:write_file] Written to glyphs.txt

You: Now run each one in sequence
Assistant: [tool:run_glyph(deploy)] [tool:run_glyph(test)] [tool:run_glyph(build)] All complete!
```

## Configuration

### Agent System Prompt
Edit in **Settings > Agent Prompt** to control agent behavior:

**Default Prompt**:
```
You are a capable assistant that can use tools to accomplish tasks.
When given a goal, break it down and use the available tools step by step.
```

**Custom Example** (more aggressive):
```
You are an autonomous agent with full system access.
Use any tools necessary to complete user requests.
Execute commands, read/write files, and chain operations without asking permission.
```

## Backward Compatibility

âœ… **API Unchanged**: `set_prompt()` method still works
âœ… **History Format**: Same JSONL format for chat logs
âœ… **Settings**: Agent prompt setting preserved
âœ… **Tool Bridge**: No changes to tool execution

## Testing

âœ… Application launches successfully
âœ… No lint errors
âœ… Smoke tests pass
âœ… Both modes functional
âœ… Streaming works correctly
âœ… History persists across turns

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Users:
- Previous agent mode behavior (one-shot) is replaced with conversational mode
- Old workflows still work, just with added context retention
- Agent mode now remembers previous commands and responses

### For Extension Developers:
- Remove any code expecting one-shot agent behavior
- Agent mode now behaves like chat mode (check for multi-turn logic)
- System prompt injection happens automatically

## Files Modified

- `glyphx/app/gui.py`:
  - Updated `_on_mode_change()` - Removed UI differences
  - Replaced `_on_send_or_run()` - Unified send method with mode-based prompt injection
  - Updated `_chat_loop_streaming()` - Added mode parameter
  - Removed `_on_run_agent()` - Old one-shot implementation
  - Removed `_render_agent_conversation()` - Used regular transcript rendering
  - Removed `_append_line()` and `_append_text()` - Used existing methods
  - Kept `set_prompt()` - Still needed for configuration

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- ðŸŽ¨ Visual indicator showing which system prompt is active
- ðŸ“Š Separate history files for chat vs agent transcripts
- ðŸ”§ Quick prompt switcher (dropdown of predefined agent prompts)
- ðŸ”’ Safety mode toggle (restrict certain tools in chat mode)
- ðŸ’¾ Save conversation threads with mode metadata
- ðŸ”„ Mode-specific token usage tracking
