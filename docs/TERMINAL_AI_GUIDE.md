# Terminal AI Assistant Guide

GlyphX now includes an **AI Assistant** mode in the Terminal panel, allowing you to interact with your terminal using natural language powered by your configured LLM.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ What Can It Do?

The Terminal AI Assistant can:

1. **Translate natural language to commands**
   - "list all Python files" â†’ `Get-ChildItem -Filter *.py -Recurse`
   - "what's my IP address?" â†’ `ipconfig`
   
2. **Explain terminal concepts**
   - "how do I find large files?"
   - "what does this error mean?"

3. **Suggest commands based on context**
   - Knows your current working directory
   - Remembers your recent commands
   - Adapts to your shell (PowerShell, Bash, etc.)

4. **Provide help and tips**
   - "how do I commit in git?"
   - "show me docker commands"
